# HIPPO: AI-Powered Interactive Learning & Lab Assistant  
### Bridging Knowledge with Intelligent AI  

## 📌 Overview  
HIPPO is an AI-driven **learning engagement platform** that leverages **real-time object detection, knowledge graphs, and AI-generated tutorials** to provide **context-aware guidance**. Unlike traditional object recognition models, HIPPO understands the **real-world intent** behind objects, retrieves relevant knowledge, and generates interactive, step-by-step tutorials for learning and task execution.  

## 🚀 Problem Statement  
### **The Gap Between Visual Perception and Actionable Knowledge**  
Current solutions like Google Lens and WikiHow fail to **connect object recognition with personalized learning**.  
- 🔍 **Object detection models** recognize items but **lack contextual understanding**.  
- 📚 **Learning resources (YouTube, WikiHow)** require **manual searching** for relevant content.  
- ❌ Existing solutions **don’t adapt to user expertise, tools, or real-world scenarios**.  

**Example Scenario:**  
*A student in a lab needs guidance on handling a chemical reaction but struggles to find instructions specific to their available equipment. HIPPO solves this by detecting lab equipment, retrieving a structured tutorial, and guiding them step by step.*  

## 🛠️ Proposed Solution  
HIPPO **analyzes images/videos**, identifies objects, determines intent, retrieves knowledge, and generates personalized tutorials. It operates in **two modes**:  

### **1️⃣ Photo Mode (Static Object Analysis)**  
- Users capture an image of an object/scene (e.g., a **disassembled circuit board**).  
- **LLaVA (Vision-Language Model)** detects objects & extracts contextual metadata.  
- **Neo4J (Graph Database)** stores object relationships and infers task intent.  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** fetches verified tutorials.  
- AI generates **interactive, step-by-step guidance** tailored to the user's need.  

### **2️⃣ Video Mode (Real-Time Scene Understanding)**  
- Users record/upload a video of an ongoing task (e.g., **assembling a 3D printer**).  
- **AI tracks object interactions over time** and identifies the workflow (e.g., “Screwdriver tightening a bolt”).  
- A **temporal reasoning module** maps sequential object movements to detect multi-step tasks.  
- **Real-time instructions overlay** onto the video feed, guiding users dynamically.

## 🔧 Core Workflow  
HIPPO follows a **structured AI pipeline**:  

1️⃣ **Input Capture:** Users upload an image/video via a **mobile/web interface**.  
2️⃣ **Object & Context Analysis:** LLaVA + YOLO detect objects, AI infers the task.  
3️⃣ **Graph Storage (Neo4J):** Objects and relationships stored for **context-aware retrieval**.  
4️⃣ **Knowledge Retrieval (RAG):** Fetches **relevant task-specific guides** from WikiHow, research papers, and forums.  
5️⃣ **Guidance Generation:** Users receive **interactive AI-driven tutorials** with real-time updates.
